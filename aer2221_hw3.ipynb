    "Using the 51 [Electoral College](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/2000) numbers that were used in the 2000 USA Presidential Election, estimate the number of ways there could have been a tie in the 2000 Presidential Election.  Use Monte Carlo simulation (using *iid* Bernoulli (1/2); e.g., a fair coin flip for each state) to simulate many elections. The fraction of elections that end in tie multiplied by the number of possible outcomes is your estimate. The exact answer to this question was determined in 2009 by K. Sigman and O. Watanabe to be 17,150,271,124,366. Your estimate should be fairly close to that number. \n",

Denote these probabilities by $p_1,...,p_{17}$. No longer are they all *p = 1/2* as we assumed in Part I. For example, for the state of Wisconsin (WI), *p = 0.946*, while for the state of Nevada (NV), p = 0.146. Only for the state of Maine (ME) is p = 0.5. Now re-do the simulation in Part I using the 17 Bernoulli $(p_i)$. The idea now is that each of the 17 states has its own coin so to speak."

    "Second, I used a list of *tuples* for the function because tuples are immutable. This makes them run faster than mutable datatypes, especially at large scales. Additionally, tuples make the function \"safer\"/more robust in that it does not rely on the unity of multiple parallel lists (that might accidentally get changed at some point in the process) to operate properly. \n",
